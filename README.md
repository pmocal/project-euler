# Background

From the [website](projecteuler.net):

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

I came up with algorithms to solve problems 1 through 8. #8 is in Java while the other solutions are in Python.
